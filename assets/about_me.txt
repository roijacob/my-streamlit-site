Hello, I am Roi Jacob C. Olfindo, an Industrial Engineering student at Mapúa University. If you have discovered this website, it's likely that I sent you the link, as I am currently seeking an internship opportunity. As such, here's what you should know about me. This isn't solely about my professional qualifications, but rather a glimpse into my persona and the journey that led me here.

Graduation is right around the corner for me, I will just need to finish my thesis (about systems simulation) and to render my internship hours and I will soon face the reality of life. After I graduate I certainly would like to pursue a career in analytics. As an industrial engineer, we have this mantra of ***✨making things better✨***, in terms of systems, processes, and much more, but it is much better to make improvements in these areas if they are analyzed quantitatively and that is where data comes to help. Businesses today utilize data to make business decisions, improve operations, and enhance customer experiences. In this era of digital transformation, data is the lifeblood that drives corporate strategy and innovation. The business landscape is obsviously heading (if not already) towards that direction. So as an Industrial Engineer, I would like to use my talents in that realm and hopefully that my upcoming internship will provide an opportunity to immerse myself in that field, allowing me to gain a valuable experience.

I would approach the opportunity with a mindset focused on learning and collaboration. While I may not claim to be the best candidate, my eagerness to learn and ability to work well with others are strengths I bring to the table. I am excited about the prospect of joining a team where I can contribute, grow, and enhance my skills in a practical, real-world setting.
