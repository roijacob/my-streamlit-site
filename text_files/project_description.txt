A work in progress. Also, I have a very basic knowledge in data engineering, that can be a bonus point for my primary skills below. I have created a simple DE project primarily in Airflow, you can view the repo [here](https://github.com/roijacob/simple-airflow).

As of now, my primary area of expertise lies in analytics. I've dedicated my leisure time to doing activities, with a keen focus on creating insightful visualizations. This practical experience has not only enriched my skill set but also deepened my passion for data analysis. My hands-on work has involved extensive use of several key tools, including:
- Excel
- Python 
- Tableau
- PostgreSQL

You can click on the headers to view the best works I've done so far. You'll notice a difference between the headers and the title in the dashboard. I design my Tableau visuals such that the title draws you into a story, while I modified the names in the headers for formality.
