A work in progress. In my free time this semester (since I am not as busy with my academics anymore), I plan to dedicate myself to building AI/ML projects, with the aim of enhancing my skills. I am also hopeful that my upcoming internship will provide an opportunity to further develop these skills in building machine learning projects and conveying data insights. 

As of now, my primary area of expertise lies in analytics. I've dedicated my leisure time to developing a range of hobby projects, with a keen focus on creating insightful visualizations. This practical experience has not only enriched my skill set but also deepened my passion for data analysis. My hands-on work has involved extensive use of several key tools, including:
- Excel
- Python 
- Tableau
- PostgreSQL
