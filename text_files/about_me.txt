Hello, I am Roi Jacob C. Olfindo, an Industrial Engineering student at MapÃºa University. If you have discovered this website, it's likely because I sent you the link, as I am currently seeking my first job opportunity ðŸ˜Š. As such, here's what you should know about me. This isn't solely about my professional qualifications, but rather a glimpse into my persona and the thought process that led me here.

Graduation has commenced, and I am currently taking a well-deserved break after the intense academic commitments at Mapua. During this pause, I plan to enjoy an out-of-country vacation before diving proactively into my job search. During the final years of my education thinking about my career, I certainly told myself that I would like to pursue analytics. As an Industrial Engineer, our mantra is ***âœ¨making things betterâœ¨***, whether it's in systems, processes, or beyond. Making improvements in these areas is more effective when they are quantitatively analyzed, and this is where data becomes invaluable. In today's business environment, data is a crucial asset, guiding decisions, optimizing operations, and enhancing customer experiences.  In this digital age, data fuels corporate strategy and innovation. Businesses are increasingly relying on data to navigate their paths forward. So as an Industrial Engineer, I would like to use my talents in that realm and hopefully that my upcoming job will provide an opportunity to immerse myself in this field, allowing me to gain a valuable experience.

I would approach the opportunity with a mindset focused on learning and collaboration. While I may not claim to be the best candidate, my eagerness to learn and ability to work well with others are strengths I bring to the table. I am excited about the prospect of joining a team where I can contribute, grow, and enhance my skills in a practical, real-world setting.
