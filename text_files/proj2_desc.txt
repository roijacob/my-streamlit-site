From the annual survey conducted by Stack Overflow, I have created a visualization focusing on the demographics of Visual Studio Code users, which is also the tool I am using to write this entire website. This was a subject of personal curiosity for me. The insights I gathered reveal that VSCode is primarily used for web development, with HTML/CSS and JavaScript being the top languages. Additionally, it indicates that the majority of users are engaged in a Work From Home (WFH) setup, either in a hybrid model or as fully remote. Furthermore, with the advent of AI tools, there has been a noticeable decrease in the frequency of Stack Overflow usage among these users.

In this project, I chose to use a cloud-based PostgreSQL database to store data, even though it wasn't strictly necessary. I wrote SQL scripts to gather the information I needed, and surprisingly, I found this approach to be much more efficient than using entire CSV files in Tableau. By injecting SQL scripts into Tableau to fetch data, I significantly reduced friction in using Tableau later. It enabled me to effortlessly drag and drop elements within Tableau, bypassing the need to create specialized calculated fields. While Tableau's language for calculated fields is user-friendly and is comparable to Python, it's very specific to the platform and not transferable. In contrast, the SQL skills I developed are versatile and can be applied in various other contexts.
