In this project, I used Apple App Store reviews of the top three private companies in the Philippines in terms of total assets. I found that most of the reviews for these banks are negative, predominantly 1-star ratings, with app functionality being the main area for improvement. This project by far delivers the most business value because it utilizes user data, and the insights are mostly actionable. This could lead to outcomes that might increase the banks' revenue, attract new customers, and much more, which is a positive gain for each of these banks.

In preparing the data, I used Python and applied NLP tasks using models from HuggingFace :hugging_face: transformers. I have thoroughly documented my entire coding process. For a detailed view, feel free to click here: [NLP Notebooks - HPBCITAA](https://github.com/roijacob/ph-banks-nlp)
